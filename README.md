# Lemurs!

[Open App](https://lemurs-are-cool.herokuapp.com/)

This was a homework project built at General Assembly while learning Python, Django, PostgreSQL, and AWS SDK. Utilizes the user authentication built into Django.

I have loved lemurs since I first saw the kids' show Zaboomafoo many years ago. This is an ode to lemurs and Madagascar. I hope one day to go visit.
